            <p>MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. Being the first veterinary facility in the Philippines and the third in Southeast Asia to provide MRI services for animals, we recognize the need of an MRI machine and its implications to progressive veterinary healthcare. This machine is utilized to map and depict visual representations of the nervous systems for both humans and animals. An MRI is considered a current gold standard for nervous system imagery outputs. It provides high-quality images with excellent detail and resolution of the brain and spinal cord, comparatively better than its inferior counterpart being widely used, computed tomography. Being a common diagnostic imaging tool, we believe this is an important machine to advance our veterinary needs. With this machine luckily right at our disposal, we can absolutely formulate quick and more accurate diagnoses beneficial in instances of brain and spinal cord diseases.</p>
