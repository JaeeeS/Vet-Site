                <p>MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. Being the first veterinary facility in the Philippines and the third in Southeast Asia to provide MRI services for animals, we recognize the need of an MRI machine and its implications to progressive veterinary healthcare.

Being a common diagnostic imaging tool, we believe this is an important machine to advance our veterinary needs.
